# Australian Synoptic Weather Types and Weather Regimes

This repository houses the Australian Synoptic Weather Types and Weather Regimes. The code herein can be used to recreate these clusters/types from ERA5 as well as assign other gridded 850hPa wind data to a synoptic weather type or weather regime.  

30 synoptic weather types are defined which are grouped into 8 weather regimes. 5 of the 8 weather regimes identify the position of large anticyclones within the domain reflecting the different phasing of extratropical wave packets over the Australian region. We refer to these regimes as the western high (WH), central high (CH), eastern high (EH), Tasman high (TH) and flanking high (FH) regimes. 2 of the 8 weather regimes are comprised of closed cyclonic circulations at the surface. The most frequent of the two closed cyclonic circulation weather regimes is the cut-off low (COL) regime, representing a deep cut-off with a surface expression. The second is characterized by a strong trough over Western Australia, which extends from the tropics over the western part of the continent, promoting a quasi-closed circulation south of the southern coastline, called west coast trough (WCT) regime. The final weather regime is the active Australian monsoon (AM) regime, which represents 60\% of the total summer climatology. It is with tropical moist margin lies over the northern part of the Australian continent and well-defined monsoon trough over northern Australia with westerly flow over or north of the maritime continent.
